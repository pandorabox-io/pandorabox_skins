Public skins available for all users.

### Adding skins

You can request a skin to be added by [opening an issue](https://github.com/pandorabox-io/pandorabox_skins/issues/new) with a link to the skin.

Alternatively you can open a pull request to add a skin. Make sure to name your skin appropriately, as described below.

To add a private skin for your player use https://pandorabox.io/ui/#/skin.


### Naming

Skins from [http://minetest.fensta.bplaced.net](http://minetest.fensta.bplaced.net/) should be named to match their ID:

- `character_[number].png` - e.g. `character_69.png`

Other skins can be named as desired, they only need a `character_` prefix.

- `character_[name].png` - e.g. `character_Sam.png`
